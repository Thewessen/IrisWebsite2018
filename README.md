# irisvanderende.nl

This page is a recreation of a webpage created using Webydo, the original
profile page of Iris van der Ende. The page is made only using HTML and CSS (and
a little bit of JavaScript). Originaly this page was created just for fun, but
now used as the official profile page of Iris van der Ende.

The page can be viewed live [here](https://www.irisvanderende.nl).

## The story

In need of a minor/simple project to work on, I started recreating the profile
page of Iris van der Ende. In my opinion, some minor improvements could be made.
In my first attempt I tried not use any JavaScript at all. Just to see how far
I would come. Later I added some JavaScript functionality.

When the contract with the hosting server (Webydo) was over, and the original
profile page was down, Iris van der Ende gradualy took this page as her new
profile page. Now this page is hosted at [Antagonist](https://www.antagonist.nl/).

The graphical designer and creator the original page, Serena Kloet, was really
happy she could work on the page with a developer. Not being bound to the
limits of a CMS she started a new design. The first scetches of the new design
can be found [here](thewessen.github.io/IrisSite).
